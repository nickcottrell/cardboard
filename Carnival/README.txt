This project is part of Udacity's VR Developer Nanodegree
https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017
Versions
- Patch 2017.1.0p4
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0


EXTRA FUN STUFF:
- Added a splash screen
- Added a 60 sec game timer. If the player doesn't score 2000 before the end, they'll hear a sad trombone and lots of boos. Also when the timer is up, no more points can be added to the scoreboard.
- Added a particle effect and more happy cheers when the player reaches the score of 2000.

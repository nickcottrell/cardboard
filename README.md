# Cardboard Apps
This is a series of VR experiences I created for the Udacity VR course. I used Unity to build and manage scenes and deployed VR applications using Cardboard. The experiences demonstrate a working knowledge of basic 3D math C# scripting.

## Carnival
This assignment started with a game experience that contained a few bugs that prevented some of the basic game play. Once I got the experience working, I went further to make the experience more interesting. I added a timer and some more engaging elements like applause for a win and boos for a lose. I also used carnival elements from the Unity Asset Store, added a daytime/sunset skybox, and re-lit and re-baked the environment.

Key concepts:
* game logic
* gameplay
* modifying scripts

## Sushi Bar
For this, I developed a custom camera from scratch. I also created all of the low poly art.

Key concepts:
* VR camera systems
* poly counts
* texture atlasing
* props &amp; environment

## Noir Apartment
The assignment for this was to create a basic apartment scene with some props that were provided. I decided to take it to the next level by developing a theme. Using assets from the Unity Asset Store, I created a creepy noir scene. I thought it would be appropriate since this unit emphasized lighting and light baking, and lighting plays such a key role in the noir genre.

Key concepts:
* Environment lighting
* Light baking
* Lightmaps
* Audio
* Animation

## Tresure Hunt
This experience utilizes scene management and navigation to create a treasure hunt experience. Users click the Waypoints to search around the island for a hidden treasure chest.

Key concepts:
* Navigation
* Scene management
* Async scene loading
* Controlling objects with scripts

## Maze
This assignment was to create a maze out experience using provided prefabs. I created the scripts, arranged the layout of the maze, pick-up objects, and optimized the scene to run on mobile. This project showcases much of what I learned throughout the course, which involves combining 3D visual elements, audio, and game logic to create a playable, immersive, and performant scene.

* More complex scripting
* Triggering behaviors
* Mobile performance
* Game design
* Ojects &amp; Scoring

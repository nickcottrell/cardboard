# Cardboard Apps
This is a series of VR experiences I created for the Udacity VR course. I used Unity to build and manage scenes and deployed the VR applications to Cardboard. The projects demonstrate a working knowledge of scene creation, basic 3D math, and C# scripting.




## Carnival
This assignment provided a mostly working game that contained a few bugs and errors preventing some of the basic gameplay. Once I got the bugs fixed and the experience working, I went further to make the it more interesting. I added a timer and some more engaging elements like applause for a win and a sad trombone for a loss. I also change the art and used carnival-themed elements from the Unity Asset Store, added a daytime/sunset skybox, and re-lit and re-baked the environment.

**Key concepts:**
* game logic
* gameplay
* modifying scripts
* integrating new functionality

## Sushi Bar
For this, I developed a custom camera from scratch. I also created all of the low poly art. This was a bonus scene that was not part of the course but further developed after some initial insights and techniques I learned.

**Key concepts:**
* VR camera systems
* poly counts
* texture atlasing
* 3D modelling

## Noir Apartment
The assignment for this was to create a basic apartment scene with some props that were provided. I decided to take it to the next level by developing a theme. Using assets from the Unity Asset Store, I created a creepy noir scene. I thought it would be appropriate since this unit emphasized lighting and light baking, and lighting plays such a key role in the noir genre.

**Key concepts:**
* Environment lighting
* Light baking
* Lightmaps
* Audio
* Animation

## Tresure Hunt
This experience utilizes scene management and navigation to create a treasure hunt experience. Users use waypoints to move around and search the island for a hidden treasure chest. Some of the assets were provided with the course, but I also added some pirate themed asset store assets. From there, I strung the experience together with an intro and loading scene to provide a more cohesive story.

**Key concepts:**
* Navigation
* Scene management
* Async scene loading
* Manipulating Shaders
* Controlling objects with scripts

## Maze
This assignment was to create a maze experience using provided prefabs. I created the scripts, arranged the layout of the maze, pick-up objects, and optimized the scene to run on mobile. This project showcases much of what I learned throughout the course, which involves combining 3D visual elements, audio, and game logic to create a playable, immersive, and performant scene.

**Key Concepts:**
* More complex scripting
* Triggering behaviors
* Mobile performance
* Game design
* Ojects &amp; Scoring

# Cardboard Apps
This is a series of VR experiences I created for the Udacity VR course. I used Unity to build and manage scenes and deployed VR applications using Cardboard. The experiences demonstrate a working knowledge of basic 3D math C# scripting.


# Carnival
This assignment started with a game experience that contained a few bugs that prevented some of the basic game play. Once I got the experience working, I went further to make the experience more interesting. I added a timer and some more engaging elements like applause for a win and boos for a lose. I also used carnival elements from the Unity Asset Store, added a daytime/sunset skybox, and re-lit and re-baked the environment.

# Sushi Bar
For this, I developed a custom camera from scratch. I also created all of the low poly art.

# Noir Apartment
The assignment for this was to create a basic apartment scene with some props that were provided. I decided to take it to the next level by developing a theme. Using assets from the Unity Asset Store, I created a noir scene.

# Tresure Hunt
This experience utilizes scene management and navigation to create a treasure hunt experience. Users click the Waypoints to search around the island for a hidden treasure chest.
